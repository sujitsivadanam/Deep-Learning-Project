In this repository, I built models that predict whether or not an offensive drive in the National Football League (NFL) ended with a score (field goal or touchdown).
The data set I used was from my summer research, when I converted the raw play-by-play NFL data, from 2009 to 2017 regular seasons, into this drive-by-drive data for my project.
